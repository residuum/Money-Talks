Money Talks is an approach to sonify and visualise the development of stock market data.

Needed for it is Puredata including the libraries list-abs, bsaylor, Gem and PuREST JSON, Python, 
cURL and a local installation of CouchDB with no admin users specified ("admin party"), plus some 
libraries, e.g. python-couchdbkit.

To init the database, run

make init

To download the data for the stock indices from Yahoo using cURL, run

make download

To import the data, run

make import

And in the end run the Pd patch with
